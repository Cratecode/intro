# Art with Code

Hopefully you now understand some of the basic ideas behind computer programming, but, let's be honest, console applications really aren't all that exciting (this does change when you start doing more advanced things, though, and so I'd urge you to check out the section that dives a bit deeper into console apps when you're ready). In this section, we'll take a look at p5.js, a piece of code that let's us create art with code. By the end of this, you'll be a bit more familiar with JavaScript (and able to make some pretty cool things in p5.js).

p5.js is also capable of making little games, which we might get a small look at in this section, but if you're interested, the next p5.js sections will definitely use it.

You probably noticed that the console disappeared. Don't worry, it's now a little p5.js window. Try seeing what it does, and take a little peek at sketch.js while you're at it.
