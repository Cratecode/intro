# What does it mean to program?
First, let's address an important different: programming and coding aren't the same thing. Cratecode uses both, since code is a lot shorter than program, but Cratecode doesn't teach people how to code. It teaches them to program.

Coding is the act of writing code. It might take a bit of memorization, and some knowledge about the language you're using. Someone who knows how to code could take a detailed document on what to write, but coding is simple.

Programming, on the other hand, is a problem-solving process that using coding. Essentially, programming is figuring out what to code, or being the one to write the detailed document. Programming is not simple. It involves understanding the problem at hand, and learning how to approach it. It means figuring out the best solution for a problem, and applying computer science concepts to figure out what to write. Cratecode teaches you how to solve problems, not how to translate an already-solved one.
